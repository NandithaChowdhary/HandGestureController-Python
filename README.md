# HandGestureController-Python
This repository contains a Python script that utilizes computer vision to control a virtual remote using hand gestures. 
The script detects hand gestures and simulates keyboard inputs to move the virtual remote either to the left or right. 
The script is built on top of the OpenCV library for computer vision and utilizes the cvzone and pynput libraries for hand detection and keyboard control, respectively.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

OpenCV (cv2)
cvzone
pynput

**Configuration**
You can adjust some parameters in the script to optimize the hand detection and gesture recognition:

detectionCon: Detection confidence threshold for hand detection. 
              Adjust this value to control the sensitivity of hand detection. 
              A higher value will make detection stricter, while a lower value may detect more false positives.
maxHands: Maximum number of hands to detect. By default, it is set to 1, but you can increase it if you need to detect multiple hands.


**Contribution**
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request in this repository. 
We welcome contributions from the community to make this script better.
